# BIGDATA 530: DATA ENGINEERING CAPSTONE

[UW PCE Course Page](https://bit.ly/40fGHGx)

530 brings together the material of its predecessor courses 510 and
520 and builds upon them, introducing some new material while allowing
students to apply what they've learned in a simulated, real-world
style data engineering project that they work on throughout the term.

Each week's three contact hours are divided roughly into 2/3 lecture,
discussion and demo, and 1/3 breakout sessions where students can work
on the week's project tasks with interactive supervision from the
instructor and TAs, who act as resources for that time.  Students then
coordinate their group's work among themselves in preparation for the
following week.
