Syllabi for Various Things I've Taught At Some Point.

Various of the courses have been offered in various places at various
times, principally:

- University of Washington, Seattle.
- As corporate trainings I developed in a past life at VMware. Some of
  them were special offerings in response to requests from strategic
  customers, others became the basis for commercially available
  training offerings provided by VMware's support organization.

I've occasionally done custom courses and trainings, based on, or
adapted from, the above, as well as some other things not reflected
here, on demand, for various corporate entities.
