# syllabi

The repository you're looking at contains syllabi for various things
I've taught at some point.
The courses and trainings have been offered in various places, at various
times, including:

- __The University of Washington__, Seattle.
- As corporate trainings I developed in a past life at __VMware__ and
  __Pivotal Software__.  Some were custom offerings in response to
  requests from strategic customers, while others became the basis for
  training offerings later offered commercially by VMware's support
  organization.
- As __custom courses and trainings__, based on, or adapted from,
the above, as well as other entirely different topics not currently
shown here.

I will occasionally do courses or trainings, on demand, for
individuals, companies or institutions.  Feel free to contact me if
you have such a need.
