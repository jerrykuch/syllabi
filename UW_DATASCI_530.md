# DATA SCIENCE 530:  Machine Learning Techniques in Data Science

The course is part of the UW PCE [Certificate in Data Science](https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/data-science) program and is divided into ten lessons, one for each week of class.

The lesson topics are:

- Lesson 01: Dimensionality Reduction:  PCA & Recommenders
- Lesson 02: Time Series Analysis
- Lesson 03: Intro to Supervised Learning, Naive Bayes & Decision Tree
- Lesson 04: Supervised Learning, Ensemble Models
- Lesson 05: Support Vector Machines
- Lesson 06: Methods for Model Explainability
- Lesson 07: Neural Networks (1): Introduction
- Lesson 08: Neural Networks (2): Deep Learning
- Lesson 09: Neural Networks (3): CNN and RNN
- Lesson 10: Model Usage (2): Deployment

To maintain consistency across different sections with different instructors, we stick to the above schedule pretty tightly.

Further coverage of some of the topics above can be found  in the UW PCE [Machine Learning Certificate](https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/machine-learning?gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAAD_QBQm1EuEGaFfQG_hIqHGTUYEI5&gclid=Cj0KCQjwy46_BhDOARIsAIvmcwPnp7vhHxdF3_4L4eVhuEJYbeRN_7qlAcbG4xh9xfufUpg5SB9g3F8aAtf9EALw_wcB) program.
