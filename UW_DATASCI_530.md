The course is divided into ten lessons, one for each week of class. The lesson topics are:

- Lesson 01: Dimensionality Reduction:  PCA & Recommenders
- Lesson 02: Time Series Analysis
- Lesson 03: Intro to Supervised Learning, Naive Bayes & Decision Tree
- Lesson 04: Supervised Learning, Ensemble Models
- Lesson 05: Support Vector Machines
- Lesson 06: Methods for Model Explainability
- Lesson 07: Neural Networks (1): Introduction
- Lesson 08: Neural Networks (2): Deep Learning
- Lesson 09: Neural Networks (3): CNN and RNN
- Lesson 10: Model Usage (2): Deployment

To maintain consistency across different sections with different instructors, we stick to the above schedule pretty tightly.
